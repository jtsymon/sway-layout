[[https://github.com/swaywm/sway][sway]] doesn't support i3's layout restoring feature, so we approximate the

* Config File
Defines the applications to launch, and where to position them.

#+BEGIN_SRC yaml
- cmdline:
    - terminal
  workspace: 4
  output: HDMI-A-2
- cmdline:

    - "--class=ranger"
    - "-e"
    - ranger
  workspace: 5
  output: HDMI-A-2
#+END_SRC

** cmdline
The command line to run. This is an array of arguments, so you don't need to

** workspace
The name of the workspace to move the application to
** output
The identifier of the output to move the workspace to
